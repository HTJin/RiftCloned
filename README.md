Dead Arrivals: Jared Lin

10:30 - Not yet met a Quorum, beginning discussion, no conclusive votes.
10:31 - Anthony arrives
10:32 - Beginning introductions -

BD - Iâ€™m Zachary Chay-Dolan, the technical lead, I am an experienced React and backend web developer, Iâ€™m here to advise the project.  Iâ€™m also providing the main context for the project, as I made the prior version.

HT - My nameâ€™s Hyun-Tae, and I work with BD at a company called Checkmate as a web developer, and I recently learned under BD how to use React, mostly frontend for now, as well as using github to collaborate on a repo.  I learned the technology weâ€™re going to use very recently, and I can give insight on what weâ€™ll need in the beginning.

10:35 -Jeremy Joins, Quorum is achieved

AA - My name is Anthony Agnone, I have worked as a freelance web designer/web developer.  I have strong HTML/CSS(background in CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap/Foundation/MaterialCSS) skills, middeling javascript and some jquery.  Iâ€™ve used PHP in production and have played with node/webpack/react/laravel etc in no production.  Iâ€™m interested in a career in Web Design/Web Dev as soon as Iâ€™m confident in my abilities.

SW - My name is Shai Weinstein, I am a two-time CS drop out at PItt, I have no web development experience BUT I play league.  I am interested in learning web development and I have knowledge about the league and Pitt community to help make the most useful website.

JK - My name is Jeremy Kato.  I major in CS at Pitt and donâ€™t have as much experience with JS or other web-frameworks but a lot in C#/Java.  Iâ€™m interested in learning how to make data services and other fun backend-ery, as well as helping design a site that people are interested in using.

Introduction to history of the project (BD) -
First OLS site was done in Python using Django, it was a bloated and disgustingly ugly piece of code maintained by one developer.  Eventually it got dropped due to changes in the Riot API which made a hackish solution to a recurring problem untenable and wouldâ€™ve required a rewrite.

Site was abandoned for about a year and a half, and then restarted.  The new version was intended to be a student run project that would be open source and easily accessible.  It became too ambitious and no students became contributors.  Since then the project died in October 2017 and has been stagnant.  The version has been dubbed Kurt and it is intended to be reborn as version Mehler.  Mehler will be the codename for development, Kurt code will be completely scrapped and the project will be restarted using more current technology and development standards intended to promote contribution.

Open question concerning History -

Whatâ€™re the version codenames for?  -
Presidents of LoL@Pitt, Kurt Torelli was the original group admin, John Mehler was the original club admin, release version will be dubbed Sandu for Gabriel Sandu and continuing on from there.

What did Riot change in the API? -
Recurring requests after a failed game code resulted in an overloaded API key as too many requests were made too quickly if a game wasnâ€™t processed by Riot.  Some games would never be processed resulting in an infinite loop on the server.  Managing the workers for requests was not something that the lone developer was knowledgeable enough to do at the time.

Topics to cover-

Primary Goals
What is the Core of the project
Technologies
Comparison to alternatives, benefits of a custom solution?
Responsibilities for individuals
Whatâ€™s the types of people we need to contribute
How do we support them in contributing
Deadline?
Looking forward as a Panel transitioning to a Board?


Why? (Comparisons to alternatives, benefits of a custom solution)

For the goals of those involved - Open source project thatâ€™s exciting and interesting in its challenges and offers teaching industry standard web technologies on a team.

For the goals of the product/end result -
Why not just use Battlefy? -
Battlefy is missing: draft application, comprehensive stat tracking, connecting tournaments together between splits, Post season and seasonal games must be separate on Battlefy, game scheduling isnâ€™t done on Battlefy, Twitch clips could be part of custom solution, other extensibility features on possible on Battlefy, custom changes are possible on NOT Battlefy,
Why not just use Google Docs? -
Automatic stats, time consuming, lots of organization from the admins, not as trustworthy

Completed question ? - 3-0 unanimous

Who? (Responsibilities for individuals)

Developers:
    Work in a Git flow like team, taking on responsibilities for tasks on a volunteer basis.  
    Services are split into different repos according to a microservice architecture

Documenters/Technical Writers (onboarding for contributions):
    Standards for documentation for developers, but only required for CORE Elements.
    Most documentation will be handled through Pull Request comments and questions

    Documentation should be as much as possible in recordings/seminars and personal communication

Designers:
    CSS framework - very generic
    Initial design spec - very simple, assign style classes to every element, redo a style pass after development is complete
    Block ourselves until a design is complete - whole team works on design before any front end work is done.

Recruiters/PR:
    Down the line, intention is to support contributions to the project, and provide more working students to move the project forward in both growth and longevity.

Deployment:
    Eric B Niu hosts the teamspeak which is what pitt.lol route to, so weâ€™ll have to set up some sort of git Hook to push master branch changes to his AWS EC2 server.
